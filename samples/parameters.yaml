#  Typical quantum gate delays for commonly used quantum gates, focused
#  primarily on superconducting qubits, which are the most mature
#  technology currently in use (e.g., IBM, Google, Rigetti). These
#  values are drawn from experimental reports and surveys in the
#  literature, especially:
#  * Krantz et al., A Quantum Engineer’s Guide to Superconducting Qubits (2019)
#  * Barends et al., Superconducting quantum circuits at the surface code threshold (2014)
#  * Sung et al., Realization of high-fidelity CZ and ZZ-free iSWAP gates with a tunable coupler (2021)
#  * IBM Qiskit pulse libraries and hardware calibrations

# Gate	          Type         Delay	   Comments
# X, Y, Z         Single-qubit 20–40 ns    Z is often virtual and can be implemented instantaneously via phase shift.
# H, S, T         Single-qubit 20–40 ns    Implemented via microwave pulses; durations are similar.
# Rx, Ry, Rz      Single-qubit 20–40 ns    Rz often virtual; Rx and Ry realized via pulse rotations.
# CNOT            Two-qubit    200–300 ns  Often decomposed into CZ + 1Q gates; varies by hardware.
# CZ              Two-qubit    30–100 ns   Faster on flux-tunable qubits (e.g., Google).
# SWAP            Two-qubit    300–600 ns  Typically composed of 3 CNOT gates.
# iSWAP           Two-qubit    150–300 ns  Parametrically driven interactions (e.g., with tunable couplers).
# CRx, CRy, CRz   Two-qubit    200–400 ns  Controlled rotations often decomposed into elementary gates.
# CCNOT (Toffoli) Three-qubit  500–1000 ns Often decomposed into 6–10 1Q/2Q gates.
# CSWAP (Fredkin) Three-qubit  700–1200 ns Decomposed into multiple Toffoli and CNOT gates.
